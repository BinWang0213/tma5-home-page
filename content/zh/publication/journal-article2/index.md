abstract: The vortex-induced vibration of the riser transporting fow was analyzed in this paper. The dynamic model which couples the efect of internal fow and external fow has been proposed based on Euler–Bernoulli beam model, slip-ratio factor model and wake oscillator model. The fnite diference scheme and generalized integral transform techniques have been adopted to solve the partial diferential equations. The infuence of the internal fow velocity, void fraction, aspect ratio and external fow velocity was studied on the vibration frequency, amplitude and modes of the riser. The results show that internal fow will lead to the drop of natural frequencies of the riser. For deepwater rises, the internal fow should be taken into consideration and the two-phase fow has signifcant infuence on the dynamic response when the riser is long. The increase in external fow velocity and aspect ratio may lead to the high mode vibration. When the riser is under the combination action of internal fow and cross-fow, the frequencies decrease and the vibration amplitudes increase with the increase in gas fraction. Under the same external fow velocity, the two-phase fow in the riser will induce a higher-order modal vibration.
