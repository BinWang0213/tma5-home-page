abstract: Wind-wave interactions impose wind forcing on wave surface and wave effects on turbulent wind structures, which essentially influences the wind-wave loading on structures. Existing research treats the wind and wave loading separately and ignores their interactions. The present study aims to characterize the turbulent airflow over wave surfaces and analyze the coupled wind-wave loading on offshore wind turbines. A high-fidelity two-phase model is developed to simulate highly turbulent wind-wave fields based on the open-source program OpenFOAM. A numerical case study is conducted to simulate extreme wind-wave conditions, where coupled wind-wave fields are applied. The intensity of wave induced turbulences and the height of wave influenced regions are affected by the wind velocity and wave heights. Higher wind velocities induce greater turbulence, which can be increased by over 100%. Then the combined wind-wave loading on offshore wind turbines is simulated under operational and extreme conditions. Under operational conditions, the wind-wave coupling effect on the combined loading is minimal. However, under extreme conditions, the coupled wind-wave fields lead to an increase in the average aerodynamic loading and a significant amplification of the fluctuation in the aerodynamic loading. Specifically, the maximum bending moment Fy at both the tower bottom and the monopile bottom experiences an increase of around 6%. The standard deviation of the shear force at the tower bottom increases by up to 45%. Also, the standard deviation of the bending moment at the tower bottom increases by approximately 27%. This study reveals the importance of considering the wind-wave coupling effect under extreme conditions, which provides valuable insights into the planning and design of offshore wind turbines.
