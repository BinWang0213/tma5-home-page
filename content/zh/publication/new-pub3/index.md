abstract: Wind-wave interaction affects the wind-wave fields and the combined loading on structures. This study aims to characterize turbulent airflow over non-breaking and breaking waves using a high-fidelity two-phase model in OpenFOAM. The volume of fluid method is utilized to model the complex air-water interface. Wind turbulence is considered via prescribing it at the inlet boundary. The model is validated against experimental data, and a numerical case study is conducted to simulate extreme wind and wave-plunging conditions. Results reveal that non-breaking waves induce wind turbulence and affect averaged wind velocity. For wave steepness exceeding 0.35, extreme wind forces amplify the turbulence by over $100\%$ at wave crests. The amplified turbulence region extends to about $0.6\lambda$ in height. When waves plunge, an overturning jet propels the wind forward, generates a counterclockwise vortex, and enhances wind turbulence. Averaged wind speeds increase by over $20\%$ above wave crests, with the enhanced region extending to a height of around $0.2\lambda$ for old waves. Maximum turbulence kinetic energy transiently increases by around $0.1C_p^2$ and maximum kinematic energy of wave-coherent velocity increases and subsequently decreases during wave plunging.
